## 🔥 Overview
The rise of embodied intelligence has intensified the need for robust multi-agent collaboration in industrial automation, service robotics, and smart manufacturing. However, current robotic systems struggle with critical limitations, including poor cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and inadequate dynamic error correction. While end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models (e.g., OpenVLA, RDT, Pi-0) exhibit weak long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models (e.g., Helix, Gemini-Robotics, GR00T-N1) lack cross-embodiment compatibility and multi-agent coordination capabilities.
To address these challenges, we present **RoboOS**, the first open-source embodied operating system based on a *Brain-Cerebellum* hierarchical architecture, facilitating a paradigm shift from single-agent to swarm intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS comprises three key components: **(1) the Embodied Cloud Model**, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for global perception and high-level decision-making;  **(2) the Cerebellum Skill Library**, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit for seamless multi-skill execution; and  **(3) Real-Time Shared Memory**, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for multi-agent state coordination. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges the Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, enabling robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration by Real-Time Shared Memory. Moreover, we optimize edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to support high-frequency interactions and scalable deployment.
Extensive real-world experiments across diverse scenarios (e.g., restaurant, household, supermarket) demonstrate RoboOS’s versatility, supporting heterogeneous embodiments (single-arm, dual-arm, humanoid, wheeled), which provides a scalable and practical solution for cross-embodiment collaboration, pushing the boundaries of embodied intelligence.

### ⚙️ 3. Skill Store Configuration
RoboOS supports two modes for accessing robot skills: **Local Mode** and **Remote Mode.**
For detailed instructions on configuring specific robot skills (e.g., Realman RMC-LA), please refer to the dedicated documentation below:

>📘 [Realman RMC-LA Skill README](https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboSkill/blob/main/realman/RMC-LA/README.md)
>Includes setup instructions, example skills, and integration guide for Realman robots.

#### ✅ Local Mode
1. Clone the RoboSkill repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboSkill
```

2. Place `skill.py` at the local path specified in the web UI
```bash
Example: slaver/demo_robot_local/skill.py
```

#### 🌐 Remote Mode
1. Host the `skill.py` file on a remote server accessible over the network (Robot)
2. Start the skill server:
```bash
python skill.py
```

### ✅ 4. Final Step
Visit the web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8888 and follow the on-screen instructions to complete configuration.
Once finished, you can control the robot and trigger skills from the interface.


##### ⚡️ 5. Start vLLM Model Service

RoboOS requires a large language model backend to handle reasoning and tool calls.  
We recommend using **vLLM** to serve the [RoboBrain2.0-7B](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/BAAI/RoboBrain2.0-7B/summary) model.


#### 5.1 Install vLLM

```bash
pip install vllm
```

#### 5.2 Prepare Chat Template
The tool_chat_template_hermes.jinja file must be provided for tool-call parsing.
Place it in the following directory:

```arduino
RoboOS/deploy/templates/tool_chat_template_hermes.jinja
```
#### 5.3 Launch vLLM
Run the following command to start the model service:

```bash
vllm serve RoboBrain2.0-7B \
    --gpu-memory-utilization=0.9 \
    --max-model-len=10000 \
    --max-num-seqs=256 \
    --port=4567 \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --enable-chunked-prefill \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --tool-call-parser hermes \
    --chat-template RoboOS/deploy/templates/tool_chat_template_hermes.jinja 
```

### ⚙️ 6. Master & Slaver Configuration
Before running the system, you need to configure both the **master** and **slaver** agents.  
Each agent requires a `config.yaml` file to define model connection, audio, and logging settings.

#### 6.1 Configuration Files
- `master/config.yaml`
- `slaver/config.yaml`

A default template is provided below (you may adjust according to your environment):

```yaml


# Cloud Server (vLLM) Model Parameters
model:
  model_select: "/workspace/model/BAAI/RoboBrain2.0-7B"
  model_retry_planning: 5
  model_dict:

    cloud_type: "default"
    cloud_api_key: "EMPTY"
    cloud_server: "http://localhost:4567/v1/"
    max_chat_message: 50

# Redis Collaborator
collaborator:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 6379
  db: 0
  clear: true
  password: ""

# Slaver Robot 
robot:
  # "local" with a fold name such as "demo_robot"
  # "remote" with URL such as "http://127.0.0.1:8000", and run the Python script 'skill.py' on the robot itself.
  # call_type: local
  # path: "demo_robot_local"
  name: demo_robot
  call_type: remote
  path: "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# Master Scene profile
profile:
  path: ./scene/profile.yaml

# Slaver
tool:
  # Has the model undergone targeted training on tool_calls
  support_tool_calls: false

```


#### 6.2 Key Parameters

+ model.cloud_server:
Must point to your vLLM service (default: http://localhost:4567/v1/)

+ collaborator:
Redis server configuration (default: 127.0.0.1:6379)

+ profile：
Path to the scene profile YAML file that defines environment and task settings (e.g., ./scene/profile.yaml)

+ tool：
Enable or disable tool-call support. Set `support_tool_calls: true` if your model has been trained for tool calls
+ robot:
Two modes of calling robot tools


⚠️ Make sure these fields are correctly configured; otherwise, RoboOS may fail to connect to vLLM, Redis, or load scene/tool profiles.


## 🔧 Manual Deployment (Advanced)
If you prefer to manually run RoboOS without using the deployment web UI, follow the steps below to start the system components directly from source.

### 1️⃣ Start the Master Agent
The **master** is responsible for receiving tasks, decomposing them, and assigning subtasks to available slaver agents.

```bash
cd master

python run.py
```
>⚠️ You must start the master agent first, otherwise the slaver will fail to register.

### 2️⃣ Start the Slaver Agent
The **slaver** connects to the master and executes the assigned subtasks on the physical robot.

```bash
cd slaver
python run.py
```
You can run multiple slaver agents on different robots or terminals, each connected to the same master.

### 📤 Sending Tasks Manually
After starting both the **master** and **slaver** agents, you can send tasks in either of the following ways:

#### ✅ Option 1: Use Python Script (Direct HTTP Request)
```bash
import requests

# Replace with your master agent's actual IP or hostname
MASTER_URL = "http://localhost:5000/publish_task"

payload = {
    "task": "Now you are at the kitchen table, pick up the apple from the kitchen table, navigate to the serving table, place the apple on the serving table, pick up the bowl from the serving table, navigate to the kitchen table, place the bowl on the kitchen table."
}

response = requests.post(MASTER_URL, json=payload)

print("Status:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())

```
> Make sure the master service is running and accessible on port 5000.

#### ✅ Option 2: Use the Release Deployment Web Interface
You can also start the deployment service and access a simple web-based task submission interface:
```bash
cd deploy
python run.py

# Then visit: http://127.0.0.1:8888/release
```

## ✨ Example Demo

### Web-Based Deployment and Configuration
